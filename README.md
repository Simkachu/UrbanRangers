# UrbanRangers
Urban Rangers fuses Kazakh heritage with cosmic vision. Using NASA data and UN SDG 11, we built an interactive eco-map of Almaty that highlights green solutions and sustainable design. Our mission is to inspire communities to connect culture, space, and ecology for a brighter urban future.
